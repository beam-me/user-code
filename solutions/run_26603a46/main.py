# Problem: Calculate the stress in a steel rod
# Plan: To calculate the stress in the steel rod, use the formula stress = force / area. The area can be calculated using the formula for the cross-sectional area of a circle, area = π * (diameter / 2)^2. Then, divide the force by the calculated area to find the stress.
# Inputs: {'force': 1000.0, 'diameter': 0.01}
